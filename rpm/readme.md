# OpenCPU rpm package

*Instructions for building OpenCPU as an rpm package.*

**warning**: Because Redhat systems do not support AppArmor, OpenCPU runs without the advanced security policies on these platforms. Instead, it runs in the standard SElinux `httpd_modules_t` context. This is fine for internal use, but it is not recommended to expose your Fedora/EL OpenCPU server to the web without further configuring SELinux for your application.

## Binary packages for Fedora, Suse

Ready-to-go opencpu-server rpm packages for recent versions of Fedora and SUSE systems are available [here](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:jeroenooms:opencpu-2.2&package=opencpu).

## Building from source

Steps to build rpm packages on Fedora, CentOS or RHEL are in this script: [buildscript.sh](buildscript.sh).

## The ocpu user API

Unlike ubuntu, the default configuration in redhat systems denies read access to the home directory of other users. Therefore, to make your home directory visible via the `/ocpu/user` api you need to set:

	chmod +rx ~

Or to do it for other users:

	sudo chmod +rx /home/username 

In addition if SELinux is enabled the `httpd_read_user_content` must be set to `true`.

## Debugging SELinux

If you get mysterious permission denied errors on Fedora or CentOS, the problem is most likely SELinux (see [blog post](https://www.opencpu.org/posts/opencpu-fedora-centos/)). The introduction video [SELinux for mere mortals](http://www.redhat.com/resourcelibrary/videos/selinux-for-mere-mortals) is a nice primer on SELinux.

To customize security policies for your needs, start by inspecting messages in `/var/log/messages` and `/var/log/audit/audit.log`. To get more verbose and readable logging, install the setroubleshoot packages:

    yum install setroubleshoot setroubleshoot-server

Most problems can be resolved by turning a SELinux "boolean" on or off. A boolean in SElinux is the term for a global flag that enables/disables a particular privilege within a particular context. The [httpd_selinux](http://linux.die.net/man/8/httpd_selinux) man page lists some important booleans for httpd that you might want to turn on/off. See also [this help page](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/19/html/Security_Guide/sect-Managing_Confined_Services-The_Apache_HTTP_Server.html). To list all booleans available on your system:

    /usr/sbin/getsebool -a | grep httpd

SELinux can also be disabled completely by editing `/etc/selinux/config` and then rebooting.

## Firewall

On most standard installations of RHEL and CentOS, the default firewall configuration is to block HTTP/HTTPS traffic from external hosts. To open port 80 (HTTP) use something like:

    sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    sudo service iptables save

Google is your friend.
